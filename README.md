# README
The goal of this code is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis, using the script called ```run_analysis.R```

## Codebook
```CodeBook.md``` describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data.

## Dataset
The data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The dataset from the course can be downloaded from:

The required database must be extracted in the repo directory.
